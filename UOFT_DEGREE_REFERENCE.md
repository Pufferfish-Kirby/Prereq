- `ABC` — Department code (3 letters), e.g., CSC = Computer Science, MAT = Mathematics
- `NNN` — Course number (3 digits)
  - 100-level: First year
  - 200-level: Second year
  - 300-level: Third year
  - 400-level: Fourth year
- `H` or `Y` — Half-year (0.5 FCE) or Full-year (1.0 FCE)

- `3` — UTM campus  
- `5` — UTSC campus

Examples:
- `CSC108H1` — Intro to Computer Programming, half-year, St. George
- `MAT137Y1` — Calculus with Proofs, full-year, St. George
- `CSC108H5` — Same course concept, UTSC campus

## Common Course Sequences (Computer Science)

### CS Major (St. George)
Required:
- CSC108H1 → CSC148H1 → CSC207H1
- CSC108H1 → CSC148H1 → CSC236H1 (or CSC240H1)
- CSC148H1 + CSC236H1 → CSC263H1 (or CSC265H1)
- MAT135H1 + MAT136H1 (or MAT137Y1) → MAT223H1/MAT240H1 → MAT235Y1/MAT237Y1
- STA237H1 or STA247H1 or STA255H1 or STA257H1

### CS Specialist (St. George)
Everything in Major, PLUS:
- CSC258H1, CSC369H1, CSC373H1
- Additional 300/400-level CSC courses
- More math requirements

### Prerequisites are STRICT
UofT enforces prerequisites through ACORN (enrollment system). A student literally cannot enroll in CSC263 without having completed CSC236 or CSC240. The planner MUST respect these chains.

## Enrollment Timing

- **Course selection opens:** July (for Fall/Winter), March (for Summer)
- **Priority enrollment:** Based on year standing and program enrollment
- **Waitlists:** Common for popular courses like CSC148, CSC207, CSC263

---

## Notes for the Planner

1. **Course load:** Standard is 5.0 FCE per year (2.5 per semester). Some students do 4.0-6.0.
2. **Summer courses:** Available but limited selection. Good for catching up or getting ahead.
3. **CR/NCR (Credit/No Credit):** Students can take up to 2.0 FCE as CR/NCR to protect GPA.
4. **Course exclusions:** Some courses are mutually exclusive (e.g., CSC236H1 and CSC240H1). Taking one means you can't take the other for credit.
5. **Anti-requisites vs prerequisites:** Anti-requisites (exclusions) prevent enrollment; prerequisites are required for enrollment.
6. **Year standing:** Based on completed FCEs, not calendar years:
   - Year 1: 0-3.5 FCE
   - Year 2: 4.0-8.5 FCE
   - Year 3: 9.0-13.5 FCE
   - Year 4: 14.0+ FCE
