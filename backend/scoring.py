    Return the top courses sorted by score (highest first).

    Uses a two-phase approach:
      1. Semantic pre-filter — for each interest, call semantic_search() to
         get the top 50 embedding-nearest courses. Take the union across all
         interests, keeping the best similarity score per course. This limits
         scoring to the ~50-150 most conceptually relevant candidates instead
         of the entire 3000-course catalog, which prevents keyword false-positives
         (e.g. a history-of-computing course scoring the same as CSC108 because
         both mention the word "computing").
      2. Full scoring — run score_course() on each candidate, injecting the
         normalised semantic similarity as the interest score component. The
         similarity is normalised relative to the top match so the best
         candidate always receives 10/10 and others scale down proportionally.

    WHY normalise relative to the top match rather than using raw cosine similarity:
        Raw cosine values vary by query ("coding" might have a max sim of 0.65
        while "machine learning" peaks at 0.82). Normalising removes this
        query-to-query variance so the interest weight (35%) is consistent
        regardless of how well the embedding space separates a particular topic.

    WHY this is separate from _strip_filler:
        _strip_filler is a token-level stop-word remover. "first year" is a

        We need the matched year integer before we remove the phrase. If we

      2. Year-level detection — scans the raw message for phrases like "first
         year", "introductory", "2nd year". When found, the candidate pool is
         restricted to courses whose code digit matches that year.
      3. Stop-word stripping — removes conversational filler so the embedding
         query reflects topic intent, not phrasing style.
      4. Year-phrase stripping — removes the now-consumed year signal from the

         embedding toward courses that *mention* "first year" in their text
         (e.g. CSC099Y1 "First-Year Learning Community") rather than courses
         *coded at* year 1 (CSC1xx).
      5. Query expansion — broadens sparse terms to include canonical synonyms

         student language and course catalog language are bridged.

         index, optionally restricted to the year-filtered candidate pool via
         a numpy boolean mask.

    WHY year filtering happens before embedding (not after):
        The embedding index has N≈3206 rows. Without pre-filtering, the top-N
        selection could be dominated by courses from the wrong year that happen
        to have high semantic similarity. With the mask, argsort only considers
        year-matched rows so the final top_n results are guaranteed to come from
        the correct year pool — no silent under-delivery.

    WHY _extract_interests_from_text() and INTEREST_SYNONYMS are not used here:
        Those were designed for the /recommend flow where the student explicitly
        declares interests. For freeform chat this function uses embedding
        similarity instead, which handles arbitrary natural language without a
        manually curated synonym map.
