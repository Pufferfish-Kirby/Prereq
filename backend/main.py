    WHY inject here rather than in the system prompt at startup:
        Sending the full 3000+ course catalog to Claude on every request is
        expensive and wastes most of the context window. By filtering to only
        the top 5 relevant courses per message, we keep the prompt tight while
        still grounding Claude's answers in real UofT course data.

    WHY extra_codes exists (bug fix):
        search_by_message() only does generic semantic search over the raw
        message text — it has no idea a matched program (see
        _build_program_context) just referenced specific course codes like
        "CSC236H1 OR CSC240H1". Semantic top-5 can easily pick one half of an
        OR-pair (CSC240H1) and miss the other (CSC236H1), so Claude ends up
        saying "CSC236H1 (not detailed in my info)" even though the course
        exists in the catalog with full prerequisite text. extra_codes lets
        the caller pass in codes that MUST be exact-looked-up and included,
        regardless of what semantic search alone would have surfaced.
