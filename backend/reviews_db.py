# WHY share the same myuoft.db file as chat history:
#   A single SQLite file is simpler to back up, ship, and reason about than
#   multiple DB files for a local MVP.  One file = one copy command, one git
#   ignore entry, one restore step.  When we migrate to PostgreSQL in Phase 2,
#   both tables move together in the same migration.
import sqlite3

# WHY import DB_PATH from chat_db instead of recomputing it here:
#   Both modules need to agree on where the DB file lives, including the
#   Railway-volume-aware fallback logic in chat_db.py. Duplicating that
#   resolution here risked the two paths silently drifting apart.
